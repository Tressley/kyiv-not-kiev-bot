# KyivNotKiev-bot ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

This Reddit bot aims to educate users on the proper English spelling of Kyiv by bringing awareness to the "KyivNotKiev" campaign.

The "KyivNotKiev" campaign is part of the broader "CorrectUA" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.
